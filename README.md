# ORM-Database

This repository contains a Node.js application that demonstrates the concept of ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) with a database using `sequelize.js`.

## Database Tables

To create the required tables in the database, I utilize `sequelize.js` models. You can find these models inside the `DB` folder within the `models` directory. Before running the application, ensure that you fill in the necessary credentials in the `.env.example` file to ensure smooth execution.

## API Documentation

For a detailed understanding of the available requests and endpoints in this Node.js application, please refer to the [Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/28416524/2s9XxsWc4K).
